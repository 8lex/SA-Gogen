# Still to be done

In the absence of a real README, here's a few commands to get you started:

    gogen gen -s weblog -c 1 -ei 1 2>/dev/null
    gogen gen -s translog -c 10 -ei 1
    gogen gen -s weblog -c 1 -i 1
    
To see how good your laptop is:

    gogen -g 4 gen -s weblog -ei 10000 -o devnull
